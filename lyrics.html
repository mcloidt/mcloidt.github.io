    <h2> Before the World Was Big </h2>
    <h3> By Girlpool </h3>
<h1>7:45 in the morning, I'm leaving my house </h1>
<h1>Trying not to think of all the ways, this place has changed </h1>
<h1>Walked around my neighbourhood </h1>
<h1>One hundred, one million, billion, trillion times </h1>
<h1>Every crack on the side-walk, below my feet </h1>
<h1>Green, black, and blue trash cans </h1>
<h1>Meet me after school </h1>
<h1>I just miss how it felt standing next to you </h1>
<h1>Wearing matching dresses before the world was big </h1>
<h1>I just miss how it felt standing next to you </h1>
<h1>Wearing matching dresses before the world was big </h1>
<h1>My brain's like a rolling snowball, I'm a fire truck </h1>
<h1>Trying not to think of all the ways, my mind has changed </h1>
<h1>Mom and Dad, I love you, do I show it enough? </h1> 
<h1>I just miss how it felt standing next to you </h1>
<h1>Wearing matching dresses before the world was big </h1>
<h1>I just miss how it felt standing next to you </h1>
<h1>Wearing matching dresses before the world was big </h1>
<h1>I just miss how it felt standing next to you </h1>
<h1>Wearing matching dresses before the world was big </h1>
<h1>I just miss how it felt standing next to you </h1>
<h1>Wearing matching dresses before the world was big</h1>
