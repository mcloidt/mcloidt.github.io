<h1>7:45 in the morning, I'm leaving my house
Trying not to think of all the ways, this place has changed
Walked around my neighbourhood
One hundred, one million, billion, trillion times
Every crack on the side-walk, below my feet
Green, black, and blue trash cans
Meet me after school
I just miss how it felt standing next to you
Wearing matching dresses before the world was big
I just miss how it felt standing next to you
Wearing matching dresses before the world was big
My brain's like a rolling snowball, I'm a fire truck
Trying not to think of all the ways, my mind has changed
Mom and Dad, I love you, do I show it enough?
I just miss how it felt standing next to you
Wearing matching dresses before the world was big
I just miss how it felt standing next to you
Wearing matching dresses before the world was big
I just miss how it felt standing next to you
Wearing matching dresses before the world was big
I just miss how it felt standing next to you
Wearing matching dresses before the world was big</h1>
